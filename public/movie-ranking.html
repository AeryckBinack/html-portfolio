<h1>The Best Movies Ever According to Eric</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Apocalypse Now</h3>
<p>An endlessly beautiful and fascinating film about war
that goes beyond simple critique and 
develops grand mythologies and Wagnerian scope.</p>

<hr />

<h3>2. Troll 2</h3>
<p>A terrible movie that's almost always hilarious
and great for those bad-movie nights. I can't 
help it, the movie is amazingly funny.</table>
</p>

<hr />
<h3>3. Dead Alive</h3>
<p>The best horror comedy of all time is almost
Peter Jackson's true masterpiece. It works as 
horror and comedy in ways you don't see with 
other flicks.</p>
